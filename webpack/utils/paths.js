// This module serves the purpose of defining and exporting two directory paths using the `path` module in a Node.js application. These paths are likely to be used throughout the application for various file operations:

// 1. **Consistency and Reusability:** By defining these paths in a central module, you ensure that the paths are consistent and standardized throughout your application. If the paths need to change in the future, you can update them in a single place (this module) instead of searching and updating them across multiple files.

// 2. **Abstraction:** This code abstracts the process of resolving paths using the `path` module. It encapsulates the logic of constructing absolute paths based on the current directory (`__dirname`) and relative paths (`../../src` and `../../build`). This abstraction makes the code more readable and maintainable.

// 3. **Avoiding Hardcoded Paths:** Hardcoding paths throughout your codebase can lead to errors and difficulties when moving or deploying your application to different environments. This module allows you to change the directory structure or move your files without having to update every instance of the paths in your code.

// 4. **Organization and Structure:** By grouping related paths together in a single module, you improve the organization and structure of your codebase. It's easier to manage and understand the paths when they are defined in a dedicated module.

// 5. **Easier Collaboration:** When working on a team, having a standardized way to access important paths can help in collaboration. Team members can easily understand where certain files or directories are located without needing to dig through the codebase.

// 6. **Testing and Debugging:** This module can also be helpful for testing and debugging. If you need to mock or replace certain directories during testing, you can modify the paths in this module to facilitate testing without changing the actual code that uses these paths.

// Overall, this code provides a clean, maintainable, and flexible way to manage directory paths in your Node.js application. It's a common practice to create such path configuration modules to handle paths consistently and abstract away the underlying path resolution logic.
